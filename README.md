# My SQL Project: U.S. Baby Names Analysis

üìå Summary Business Case

This project delves into over a century of U.S. baby naming trends using SQL. By analyzing data from the U.S. Social Security Administration, the study aims to uncover patterns in name popularity, gender-based preferences, and the evolution of naming conventions over time. Such insights are invaluable for marketers, sociologists, and businesses aiming to understand cultural shifts and consumer behavior.

üõ†Ô∏è Key Steps & Technical Highlights

* Data Preparation:

Utilized SQL scripts to create and populate the baby_names database.

Data spans from 1980 to 2020, encompassing names, birth counts, gender, and year.

* Data Cleaning & Transformation:

Standardized name formats and ensured data consistency.

Handled missing values and anomalies in the dataset.

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Identified top names per decade and their longevity.

Analyzed gender-based naming trends and shifts over time.

Examined the rise and fall of specific names.

* Advanced SQL Techniques:

Employed window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK) to determine name rankings.

Used CASE WHEN statements for categorizing names based on popularity.

Implemented subqueries and common table expressions (CTEs) for complex analyses.
